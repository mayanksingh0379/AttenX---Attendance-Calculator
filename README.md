# AttenX---Attendance-Calculator
AttenX is a attendance calculator and tracker for college students.
My purpose was to host and run it locally on my phone. (Given below)

Built with the help of GPT-5, this is college attendace tracker.
Check you daily attendance visually on a calendar and also a percentage based on each individual class.

The Daily page tracks your daily college attendance which basically means whether you showed up to college or not.
The Classes page tracks your attendance for each class.
You can add and remove classes from your list.
You can download the .json data file for your attendance data or use another .json file for previous data (great for when you are changing your phone).

To run it on your phone:
1. Put all the files in one folder and transfer that it to your smartphone (I used google drive for this).
2. Download "SHTTPS" from play store.
3. Select the folder containing the program as your 'Root Folder'.
4. Start the server and copy the local link and run it on a browser.
5. Add the website to homescreen and use it as an app.

Note: You will need to run the local server each time you want to use the app but that's a minor tradeoff.
